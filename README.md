**Professional Self-Assessment and Artifact References**
Diana Galvez Mendez 

This ePortfolio is the end result of everything I’ve learned and accomplished, and proof of how much I’ve grown as a developer, problem solver, and collaborator. The capstone experience brought all my skills together in one place, showing that I can take an idea, break it down into steps, and turn it into something functional, efficient, and secure. 
Throughout the program, I’ve learned how valuable it is to work well in a team, whether that’s through agile projects or giving and receiving code reviews. Clear communication became just as important as writing clean code, especially when explaining technical details to stakeholders who don’t speak “developer.”

I’ve also built a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, which means I can approach a problem and choose the right tools to solve it in the most efficient way possible. In software engineering and databases, I’ve applied SDLC best practices, design patterns, and database management techniques, everything from designing relational schemas to ensuring security and scalability. On the security side, I’ve gotten comfortable with implementing authentication, secure coding standards, and data protection practices so my projects aren’t just functional, but safe.
This program solidified what I want from my career: building meaningful, well-designed technology solutions that are reliable, user-friendly, and secure. I value continuous learning, creating software that’s accessible to everyone, and developing with ethics and privacy in mind.

**My eportfolio includes three enhanced artifacts, each highlighting a different skill set:**

Software Engineering Enhancement: An upgraded Android event-tracking app with a cleaner interface, stronger input validation, and better user experience.

Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement: A reinforcement learning “Pirate Intelligent Agent” using optimized Q-learning logic to navigate a treasure-hunt environment.

Database Enhancement: A Storm and Crime Data Report system integrating a relational database with optimized queries for validating, analyzing, and visualizing data.

Each project is strong on its own, but together they show the full range of my abilities: planning, coding, optimizing, securing, and delivering a final product that meets user needs.
